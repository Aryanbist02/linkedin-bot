Sends invitation to people on linkedin.

positional arguments:
  {limit}               available actions
    limit               sets the daily invitation limit

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -e [EMAIL], --email [EMAIL]
                        User's email address
  -p [PASSWORD], --password [PASSWORD]
                        User's password
  -c, --cookies         uses cookies for authentication
  -i, --incognito       set browser in incognito mode
  -ngpu, --headless     starts chrome in headless mode
  -m, --start-maximized
                        set browser in full screen
```

You can use the `send` command like this:

```shell
$ python3 inb/inb.py send --email "ayush854032@gmail.com" --password "F:(:);GVlk"
```

The above command will send invitations to `40` people on LinkedIn. The reason it sends only `40` invitations because the daily
connection limit is not given.

Set the daily connection limit.

```shell
$ python3 inb/inb.py send --email "ayush854032@gmail.com" --password "F:(:);GVlk" limit 60
```

The above command will send invitations to `60` people on LinkedIn.

The limit must not exceed by `80` otherwise LinkedIn will block you for months. The default connection limit is `40` (recommended),
means if the limit is not given then `inb` will only send invitations upto `40`.

In case, you have a special character in any of your _email_ or _password_ field then you may want to escape it with the character
`(\)`, otherwise it will create problems.

For example:

```shell
$ python3 inb/inb.py send --email "ayush854032@gmail.com" --password "F:(:);GVlk\`"
```

Notice, how I escaped the ```(`)``` character using the `(\)` character. Any kind of escape sequencing will work with `inb`.

Let's talk about flags.

If you want to start sending invitations in `headless` mode, means without opening the browser window then you may want to do this,

```shell
$ python3 inb/inb.py send --email "ayush854032@gmail.com" --password "F:(:);GVlk\`" -ngpu
```

You can either use `-ngpu` or `--headless` both stands for headless mode.
