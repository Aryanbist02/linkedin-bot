# Testing

## [unittest][_unittest]

I use [unittest][_unittest] framework for testing it also comes with a built-in test runner. If you have a python version that is greater than 3.7 then [unittest][_unittest] is already present in your system.

Otherwise install it using the following command,

```shell
$ pip install unittest
```

## Run Tests

You can run tests on `linkedin-bot` by executing the following command on the project's root directory.

```shell
$ ./scripts/test.sh
```
