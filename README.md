# inb ðŸ¤–

This command line tool is very helpful to increase your connections on **LinkedIn**, you are going to achieve **500+** connections very easily.

## Installation

### git

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/JoshiAyush/inb.git inb
$ cd inb
$ sudo ./scripts/rwx.sh
```

Executing script `rwx.sh` will change the directory permissions and will also set the `core.filemode` variable of `git` to `false` so that `git` doesn't track the filemode's if the project is in someone else's computer.
