## Installation

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/JoshiAyush/inb.git inb
$ cd inb
```

Executing script `rwx.sh` will change the directory permissions and will also set the `core.filemode` variable of `git` to `false`
so that `git` doesn't track the filemode's if the project is in someone else's computer (only do this if you want to contribute to
`inb` otherwise for just using `inb` you don't really need to do that).

```shell
$ sudo ./inb.sh --rwx
```

Execute the above command from the project's root directory to change the filemodes.

## Dependencies

You have to install dependencies required for `inb`.

```shell
$ python3 -m pip install requirements.txt
```

Alternatively,

```shell
$ ./inb.sh --install
```

## inb

Execute the below command from the project's root directory.

```shell
$ python3 inb/inb.py -h
```

You will get a output something like this:

You target a specific industry by using the `--keyword` flag of `search` command.

```shell
$ python3 inb/inb.py search --email "ayush854032@gmail.com" --password "F:(:);GVlk\`" --keyword "Software Developer"
```

The above command will start sending invitation to people who belong to _Software Developer_ industry.

## Personalize your request messages

Create a template file name **message.txt** inside folder **inb**.

**message.txt**

```text
TEMPLATE BEGIN:
Hi {{name}},

I'm on a personal mission of expanding my network with like-minded professionals.

If that sounds good, let's connect!
TEMPLATE END;
```

Now use this template to customize your connection request messages.

```shell
$ python3 inb/inb.py search --email "ayush854032@gmail.com" --password "F:(:);GVlk\`" --keyword "Software Developer" --location "United States" --message message.txt
```

**Note: inb will replace the {{name}} with the person name you are sending request to.**
